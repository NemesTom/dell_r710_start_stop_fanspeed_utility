# dell_r710_start_stop_fanspeed_utility
Simple tool written in python that helps me start my homelab server without using the idrac gui.
It can also set fanspeed which is nice since it sounds like a jet taking off when left to auto-adjust. 
Uses tkinter and ipmitool.

To use the ipmitool command download this for windows:
